# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project to predict diabetes status. Various models, including Random Forest and XG Boost, are used to predict diabetes based on medical parameters.


## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:
* Descriptive_FAMD_lOGISTIC.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, descriptive analysis of several variables, factor analysis for mixed data, chi square tests , fitted logistic regression, elastic net regression and KNN models.
* RandomForest_and_Clustering - Copy.ipynb:Jupyter Notebook with fitted Ridge regression model, RandomForest model and Kprototype Clustering algorithm.

## Data Preprocessing
Involve cleaning data, dealing with missing values and data scaling.

## Models Used
* Logistic Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Random Forest
* XG Boost
* Elastic Net Regression
* KNN

## Acknowledgements
The dataset used in this project is publicly available in Kaggle website.
